<h2 id="create-a-project-folder">1. Create a project folder</h2>

<p>The project folder should be called “message-board” and be in an easy-to-find projects folder.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-db-folder">2. Create a db folder</h2>

<p>Inside the project folder, create a folder called “db” which will contain all database-related files.</p>

<h2 id="create-an-empty-database">3. Create an empty database</h2>

<p>The database should be called “message-board.db” and should be saved in the db folder.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-table-diagram">4. Create a table diagram</h2>

<p>The table diagram should specify all table names, data types, keys and relationships. It should be stored in the db folder under the name “table-diagram.png”.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-database-schema">5. Create a database schema</h2>

<p>The file should be in the db folder and should be called “schema.sql”. This file should be used to generate the tables in the database.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-source-of-dummy-data">6. Create a source of dummy data</h2>

<p>The file should be in the db folder and should be called “dummy-data.sql”. This file should be used to populate a freshly created version of the database.</p>
