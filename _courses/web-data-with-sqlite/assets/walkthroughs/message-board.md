# Message Board Project Walkthrough



## 1. Create a project folder

The project folder should be called "message-board" and be in an easy-to-find projects folder.



## 2. Create a db folder

Inside the project folder, create a folder called "db" which will contain all database-related files.



## 3. Create an empty database

The database should be called "message-board.db" and should be saved in the db folder.



## 4. Create a table diagram

The table diagram should specify all table names, data types, keys and relationships. It should be stored in the db folder under the name "table-diagram.png".



## 5. Create a database schema

The file should be in the db folder and should be called "schema.sql". This file should be used to generate the tables in the database.



## 6. Create a source of dummy data

The file should be in the db folder and should be called "dummy-data.sql". This file should be used to populate a freshly created version of the database.



## 7. Create a backup script

This script should have a creation date in the file name and should contain all data currently stored in the database.



## 8. Create a Flask app

Copy the folder called "public" from the flask starter into the "message-board" project folder. That means the "message-board" folder now contains two subfolders, "db" and "public".
