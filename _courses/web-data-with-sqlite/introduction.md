      ## Apps we need

      We use a wide selection of tools in this course.
      Let's quickly discuss what they are each for.

      ### Web Browser

      We're building a website, so a web browser is critical!
      We recommend Google Chrome and use it for demos.

      ### Code Editor
      
      We recommend a simple but modern editor,
      such as [SublimeText](http://sublimetext.com){:target="_blank"}, [Atom](http://atom.io){:target="_blank"} or [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com){:target="_blank"}.

    notes: |

      You're welcome to use a code editor of your choice, but check out our recommendations if you have a chance!

      ### SQLite3

      The latest version of SQLite works really nicely
      with Python, so we'll use it for our app.

      ### Python 3

      Python will be the "back-end" of our website,
      communicating between our web page and database.
