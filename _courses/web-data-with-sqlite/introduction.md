      ## Apps we need

      We use a wide selection of tools in this course.
      Let's quickly discuss what they are each for.

      ### Web Browser

      We're building a website, so a web browser is critical!
      We recommend Google Chrome and use it for demos.

      ### Code Editor
      
      We recommend a simple but modern editor,
      such as [SublimeText](sublimetext.com), [Atom](atom.io) or [Visual Studio Code](code.visualstudio.com).

    notes: |

      You're welcome to use a code editor of your choice, but check out our recommendations if you have a chance!

      ## Command Line Tools

      We also need some tools installed which
      can only be used from the shell.

      ### SQLite3

      The latest version of SQLite works really nicely
      with Python, so we'll use it for our app.

      [Download SQLite](sqlite.org/download.html)

      ### Python 3

      Python will be the "back-end" of our website,
      communicating between our web page and database.

      [Download Python3](python.org/downloads)

      ### Flask

      Flask is a framework for Python which makes
      it easier to build websites with databases.
